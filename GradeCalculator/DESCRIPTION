Description: The goal of the gradecalculator package is to provide functions that allow students to calculate their 
    course grades easily in different scenarios. For example, at what percent they currently stand in their course with 
    the grades they have received thus far. This package currently only consists of one function, 'what_grade()'. 
    This function  makes calculating the final exam grade you need to achieve a certain grade in a course easier.
